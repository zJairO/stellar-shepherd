Hello world!

I am Jairo, a software engineer who enjoys the focus and logic behind every line of code I write.

I code in C++, JavaScript, Php, Python and just about any language I find right for the project and exciting. At some point in the past, I was a happy systems engineer also accepting managerial roles, but things change as time goes on, just like our taste. Today I prefer to focus on my main fields of interest: Web Applications, Internet of Things and DevOps.

If my contributions are useful to you, can buy me a coffee.
